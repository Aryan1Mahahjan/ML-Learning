Working through an example project , main steps to walk through:

1. [[Look at the big picture]]
2. [[Get the data]]
3. [[Explore and Visualize the data to gain insights ]]
4. [[prepare the data for machine learning algorithms]]
5. [[Select a model and train it]]
6. [[Fine tune your model ]]
7. [[Present your Solution]]
8. [[Launch,moniter and maintain your system]]
