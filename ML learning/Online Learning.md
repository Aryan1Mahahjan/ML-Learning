You training the system incrementally by feeding it data instance in small groups called mini-batches.'t to changes 

#### Use for this System:
- systems that need to adapt to changes quickly.
- Systems having limited computing resources.
- train huge datasets which cannot fit in machine's memory
- Has higher learning rate compared to [[Batch Learning]]

#### Problem with this System
The system will perform poorly if it is feed bad data. To reduce this risk we need to monitor your system closely and turn off learning.
