The training set you includes desired solution called **Labels**.

#### Typically used for :
-  *Classification*:eg -determining weather an email is spam or ham
- *Regression*: to predict **target** numeric value given a get set of **features** called **predictors**. Eg- evaluating price of car based on it mileage ,age ,brand, etc.
- Some regression algorithms can be used for classification. eg - Logistic Regression 

#### Important Supervised learning algorithms:
1. [[k-Nearest Neighbors]]
2. [[Linear Regression]]
3. [[Logistic Regression]]
4. [[Support Vector Machine(SVMs)]]
5. [[Decision Trees and Random Forests]]
6. [[Neural Networks]]
