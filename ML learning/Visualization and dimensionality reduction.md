Feeding them a lot to complex and unlabeled data and outputs in 2D and 3D representation.
It helps us to understand how the data was organized and identify patterns.

**Dimensionality Reduction** : the goal to simplify the data without losing too information.One way to do this merge several correlated features into one.

### Important Algorithms
- [[Principal Component Analysis(PCA)]]
- [[Kernal PCA]]
- [[Locally Linear Embedding(LLE)]]
- [[t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding(t-SNE)]]
