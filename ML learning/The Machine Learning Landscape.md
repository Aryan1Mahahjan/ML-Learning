## What is Machine Learning?

A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P,  if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

or 

Field of study that gives computers the ability  to learn without explicitly programmed.

The data that is trained is called a training set.


#### Machine learning is great for :
- Since the Machine Learning system are learning from data, it simplifies the code and it performs better that traditional approach
- Finds solution to complex problems .
- Helps Us get insight about complex problem and large amount of data (This called **data mining**)

## Types of Machine Learning system

- [[Supervised Learning]]
- [[Unsupervised Learning]]
- [[Semi-supervised Learning]]
- [[Reinforcement Learning ]]
- [[Online Learning]]
- [[Batch Learning ]]
- [[Self-supervised Learning]]
- [[Instance-based Learning]]
- [[Model-based Learning]]


## Main Challenges of Machine Learning
- *Insufficient Quantity of Training Data* : For very simple problems you need thousands of examples and for complex problems (eg images or search) you need millions of examples.
- *Non representative Training Data* : To the ensure the train the model on the newest model. very small sample - sampling noise and very large samples - sampling bais 
- *Poor-Quality Data*: Data full of errors
- *Irrelevant Features*: Sampling should only contain relevant features.
- *Over-fitting the Training Data*: Where the model does not on generalize well and perform well on trained data.
- *Under-fitting the Training Data*:model is too simple to learn.
